Mathematical moves for robust GPs/SPs
*************************************

There are 5 mathematical steps to being able to apply principles
from linear robust optimization to geometric and signomial programming.

- Linear programs (LPs) have tractable robust counterparts.
- Two-term posynomials are LP-approximable.
- All posynomials are LP-approximable.
- GPs have robust formulations.
- RSPs can be represented as sequential RGPs.

Work in progress...
