Welcome to robust's documentation!
==================================

robust is a framework for engineering system optimization
under uncertainty using geometric and signomial programming. 

Robust optimization is a tractable stochastic optimization
method that protects against uncertain parameters in 
well-defined sets, and optimizes for the worst case objective. 


This website is under construction. If you have 
a GP model that you would like to robustify but are not able to find answers to your questions in the documentation,
please feel free to post `issues <https://github.com/convexengineering/robust/issues>`_
and suggest areas for improvement.
