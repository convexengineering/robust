Why robust optimization? 
************************

Firstly we should ask, why optimization under uncertainty? 



SPaircraft is a signomial programming compatible transonic aircraft conceptual design optimization tool.
It is of similar level of fidelity as TASOPT, and can perform the single- and multi-mission optimization of many
different configurations of aircraft.

    * `Efficient and Reliable Aircraft Multidisciplinary
Design Optimization via Signomial Programming
<http://hoburg.mit.edu/publications/SP_tasopt_watermark.pdf>`_ extends these models to multiple
aircraft configurations, and demonstrates the advantages of SPaircraft relative to other existing
multidisciplinary design optimization tools.
