Why robust optimization? 
************************

Firstly we should ask, why optimization under uncertainty? 

Comparison of general SO methods with RO
========================================



Advantages of RO over SO
========================

Tractability
------------

In general, SO methods are intractable due to the nature of
and methods for uncertainty propagation. The propagation of probability distributions of parameters through physics
requires the integration of PDFs with objective and constraint
outcomes. Since this is difficult, this is often achieved 
through high-dimensional quadrature and the enumeration of
potential outcomes into scenarios. 

Probabilistic guarantees
------------------------

RO methods give probabilistic guarantees of constraint
satisfaction for uncertain outcomes within a 
defined uncertainty set.
