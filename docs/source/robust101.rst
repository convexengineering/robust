Robust 101
**********

This section will help you understand the basic ideas behind robust optimization (RO),
and get started with **robust** provided that you have a GP- or SP-compatible model.

What is RO?
-----------

RO is a tractable method for optimization under uncertainty, and specifically under uncertain
parameters. It optimizes the worst-case objective outcome over uncertainty sets,
unlike general stochastic optimization methods which optimize statistics of the distribution
of the objective over probability distributions of uncertain parameters. As such, RO
sacrifices generality for tractability, probabilistic guarantees and engineering intuition.
