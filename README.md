## robust
robust is a tool for designing engineering systems under uncertainty using geometric and signomial programming. Four different formulations of approximate robust geometric programming are implemented, for norm uncertainty sets over parameters in models formulated in [GPkit](https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit). 

Documentation for robust is available [here](https://robust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but is still under development. If you have any questions as you robustify your models, please contact Berk Ozturk (bozturk@mit.edu) and Ali Saab (alikassemsaab@gmail.com). Please let us know if you have any suggestions for improvement and enhancement, as well as interesting applications!
