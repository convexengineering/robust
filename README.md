# Robust geometric and signomial programming assumes that uncertainties belong to an uncertainty set, and solves the problem for the worst case scenario.

# Robust is a tool for manipulating geometric and signomial programs under uncertainty. four different formulations of approximate robust geometric programming are implemented.

# This repository has tools that can test your design given different formulations and uncertainty sets.
