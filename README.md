## robust
robust is a tool for designing engineering systems under uncertainty using geometric and signomial programming. Four different formulations of approximate robust geometric programming are implemented, for norm uncertainty sets, for models formulated in [GPkit](https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit). 

Documentation for robust is pending. In the short term, if you are interested in robustifying your GP models, please contact Berk Ozturk (bozturk@mit.edu) and Ali Saab (alikassemsaab@gmail.com).
