# Robust is a tool for manipulating geometric and signomial programs under uncertainty. Robust geometric and signomial programming assumes that uncertainties belong to an uncertainty set, and solves the problem for the worst case scenario by finding the best solution that is feasible to all possible realizations from the uncertainty set.
